<!--
Hello,

Thank you very much for your interest in this project!

For requests other than translations, could you please explain the context and purpose in the description?

I like to improve my code following feedback but have to admit that doing code review is not my cup of tea.
For now I prefer to manage all the code myself as the project is small enough to allow it. This is what personally motivates me in maintaining this project.
Consequently, don't be surprised if pull requests related to code are closed.
Instead, feel free to suggest improvements in the "Issues" tab so we can discuss them together.

Best regards.
